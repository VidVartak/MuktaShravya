# MuktaShravya
Copyright free (mostly old) Indian audio books read by volunteers

Mukta Shravya literally means "Free Audio" in Sanskrit (which is the ancient language of India from which many of the modern Indian languages have derived or borrowed from).

This is a project where volunteers will be able to collaborate in finding and recording old Indian books into an audio book and make them available for listeners.
